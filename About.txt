The above application is a fully functional react web app created using React Hooks, AJAX and backend using node.js.

The backend will auto generate an inventory table once we run it via command prompt.
The steps on how to run the backend is already in the backend folder.
The backend here is simply fetching the inventory to your local host.

Now comes the frontend. Again the steps on how to run the frontend is already in that folder.
Frontend allows you to perform CRUD functionality on the existing inventory fetched from the backend.
There is also Search functionality added to the frontend file that will display the Seacrch table at the bottom of the web page.
